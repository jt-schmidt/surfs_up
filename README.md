Module 9 -- SQLITE, SQL Alchemy, Flask project

## Overview
In this module's course & challenge, various exercises performed are:
- Query data from a SQLITE database file using SQL Alchemy in Python
- Build a dataframe using Pandas
- Plot data using MatPlotLib
- Generate local web page content from Python using Flask

For the challenge in particular, SQLITE database of 2 tables is provided:
- Measurement
  - Station ID where data 
  - Date of data collection
  - Precipitation data
  - Temperature data
- Station
  - Station ID
  - Station Name
  - Station geographical info (latitude, longitude, elevation)

Objective are to:
1. Query temperature data for all June months and place into a Pandas Data Frame to provide a statistical description.
2. Repeat for all December months.
3. Analysis comparing results from #1 and #2 including 2 additional queries for proposed analysis.
